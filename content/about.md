# SampTA 2023
## 14th International conference on **Sampling Theory and Applications**

This year's <i> Sampling Theory and Applications </i> conference will be held at Yale University from July 10-14th, 2023. [Registration is open until July 14.](https://web.cvent.com/event/903a729f-b298-40ca-a060-3f0447be7bbc/summary). 
<!-- 
We have a [Call for Papers](https://sampta2023.github.io/call-for-papers/) on sampling theory, signal and image processing, and data analysis. Papers accepted by SampTA will be published in a special issue of IEEE Xplore. -->

Our [Plenary Speakers](https://sampta2023.github.io/speakers/) will include Coralia Cartis, Rebecca Willett, and Mark Iwen, among many others. In addition, we have eight special sessions on topics including manifold learning, randomized algorithms, sampling theory in neuroscience, and more. See [our full list here](https://sampta2023.github.io/speakers/).

We are technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society.

## About SampTA

SampTA (Sampling Theory and Applications) is a biennial interdisciplinary conference for mathematicians, engineers, and applied scientists. The main purpose of SampTA is to exchange recent advances in sampling theory and to explore new trends and directions in the related areas of application. The conference focuses on such fields as signal processing and image processing, coding theory, control theory, real analysis and complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and the theory of differential equations. SampTA features plenary talks by prominent speakers, special sessions on selected topics reflecting the current trends in sampling theory and its applications to the engineering sciences, as well as regular sessions about traditional topics in sampling theory. Contributions from authors attending the SampTA conferences are usually published in IEEE Xplore

The SampTA conference series began as a small workshop in 1995 in Riga, Latvia, but the meetings grew into full-fledged conferences attracting an even mix of mathematicians and engineers as the interest in sampling theory and its many applications blossomed. This even mix makes the SampTA meetings unique in the scientific community. The conference organization is headed by an international steering committee consisting of prominent mathematicians and engineers, and a technical committee responsible for the conference program.
