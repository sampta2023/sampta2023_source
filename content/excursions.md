# Yale Art Gallery Guided Tour

Yale's well-endowed University Art Gallery features exhibitions drawn from a collection of over 180,000 relics. 
As their [webpage attests](https://artgallery.yale.edu/):

> The Galleryâ€™s encyclopedic collection can engage every interest. Spanning one and a half city blocks and three buildings, the museum features more than 4,000 works on display as well as a rooftop terrace and a sculpture garden. Galleries showcase artworks from ancient times to the present, including vessels from Tang-dynasty China, early Italian paintings, textiles from Borneo, treasures of American art, masks from West Africa, modern and contemporary art, ancient sculptures, masterworks by Degas, van Gogh, and Picasso, and more.

# Yale Tour

Yale's campus embodies a certain self-conscious grandeur. Its most iconic buildings were designed after (or, in the case of Sterling Memorial Library, *as*) cathedrals -- but dedicated to what philosopher Robert Pirsig called "The Church of Reason". 
In Sterling Memorial Library, for instance, the gargoyles hold pens and books, their leering expressions perfectly matching the feelings of those students studying for midterms.

After witnessing this cluster of collegiate-gothic monuments, you can walk up Hillhouse Avenue, a street shaded by towering elms and stately buildings, which Mark Twain called "the most beautiful street in America." At the top is the expanse of shining glass and towering brick students call "Science Hill". 

# East Rock
From the conference venue, the East Rock summit is 3.5 miles of mostly flat walking through the Yale campus and then onto paved neighborhood streets. There is a short, strenuous climb at the end, ascending 300 vertical feet up a series of giant stone steps. The spectacular views from the top look out over New Haven and the Long Island Sound.

For the return trip, one can either retrace the 3.5 miles, or take a convenient Yale shuttle back to the venue/hotels to shorten the journey. **Comfortable walking shoes and a water bottle are recommended.**
