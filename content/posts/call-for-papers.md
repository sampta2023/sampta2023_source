The 14th annual conference on Sampling Theory and Applications is an interdisciplinary forum for mathematicians, engineers, and applied scientists to share recent advances in sampling theory and discuss trends in the field and its applications. We now invite submissions of original research in topics including:

**Sampling Theory**

- sampling of space-time deterministic or stochastic signals
- sampling on the sphere and on more general manifolds
- sampling on graphs
- compressive sensing
- sampling theory in reproducing kernel Hilbert and Banach spaces
- frame theory and its applications in sampling theory
- shift-invariant and spline-type spaces
- approximation error analysis and local reconstructions
- analytic number theory and lattice point methods in sampling expansions
- sampling in coorbit theory and group representations
- aspects of function spaces in sampling theory (Sobolev spaces, Besov spaces, Wiener amalgam spaces and others)
- operator and functional analytic methods related to the above topics

**Signal and Image Processing**

- audio and image processing
- signal processing and inverse problems on graphs
- signal transforms such as the scattering transform
- wavelets, shearlets, Gabor expansions
- atomic decompositions and related transforms
- information theory and communications
- analog to digital conversion and quantization
- phase retrieval problems
- control theory methods in signal processing
- interaction between inverse problems, signal analysis, and image processing
- operator and functional analytic methods related to the above topics

**Data Analysis**

- machine learning and neural networks
- high dimensional data analysis and manifold learning
- application of frame theory in data analysis
- mathematical foundations of deep learning
- probabilistic methods for data analysis
- reproducing kernel methods in machine learning and data analysis
- inverse problems, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification
- sparsity in data analysis
- quantum computing and quantum learning
- operator and functional analytic methods related to the above topics

Contributions from authors attending the SampTA conferences are usually published in special issues of [Sampling Theory, Signal Processing, and Data Analysis](https://www.springer.com/journal/43670/aims-and-scope), an international journal dedicated to sampling theory and its applications.

Our submission instructions and review process follow standard [NeurIPS Guidelines](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers).

## Formatting Instructions:

Submit a PDF of **no more than 4 pages**, including figures and tables, using the style

```
\documentclass[conference] {IEEEtran}
```

Submissions that try to squeeze in extra text by tweaking the stylesheet may be summarily rejected.

Accepted submissions will be granted one extra page of content for the camera-ready version.

## Double-blind reviewing:

Submissions must be anonymized and carefully stripped of identifying information. This applies not only to the main body of the paper, but also the supplement and any linked resources (e.g. GitHub repositories).

## OpenReview

(Details to be announced)

## Abstract Submission

Abstracts must be submitted a week before the full submission deadline. Small edits to the title and abstract are permitted, but submissions whose abstracts are substantively changed may be rejected without further consideration. The author list can be changed until the full paper deadline, after which authors may be reordered, but not added or removed without special permission.

## Supplementary Material

You may include up to 100MB of supplementary material (appendices, proofs, data, source code), in either PDF or ZIP format. Take care that this is anonymized! Reviewers have no obligation to review the supplementary material.

## Preprints

You are allowed to distribute non-anonymous preprints of work submitted to SamPTA.

## Dual Submissions

Submissions to SamPTA will be rejected if they are considered too similar to works previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed journals. The exception: work from non-archival workshops, such as NeurIPS/ICML workshops, may be submitted.

## Author Responses

After initial reviews are distributed, authors will have one week to respond. Authors must maintain anonymity in their responses.

After the response period, accepted papers will be made public, along with their anonymous reviews and comments. Authors of rejected papers may elect to have their deanonymized rejected paper made public in OpenReview.

## Publication of Accepted Submissions

We encourage all authors to make their code and data available along with the publication. Additionally, all camera-ready papers must include a funding disclosure.
