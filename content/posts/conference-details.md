## Wednesday's Excursions

Each attendee of SAMPTA 2023 will have the option of one of 3 excursions:

1. Yale Art Gallery guided tour (capped at 30 people), 
2. Yale Tour (Capped at 75 people), 
3. Hike up East Rock (no cap)
	- From the conference venue, the East Rock summit is 3.5 miles of mostly flat walking through the Yale campus and then onto paved neighborhood streets. There is a short, strenuous climb at the end, ascending 300 vertical feet up a series of giant stone steps. The spectacular views from the top look out over New Haven and the Long Island Sound. For the return trip, one can either retrace the 3.5 miles, or take a convenient Yale shuttle back to the venue/hotels to shorten the journey. Comfortable walking shoes and a water bottle are recommended.
