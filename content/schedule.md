Lunch is 12pm-1:30pm daily. Lunch is on your own and a chance to network. There are several nearby options for lunch. These include: 
1. **Food carts** on Cedar street. Starting at about 11:30 there is
   a tradition of food carts parking on Cedar street between York and
   Congress. This is the main street for the Yale School of Medicine and
   Hospital. There are a variety of cuisines represented including
   Italian, middle eastern, Chinese, Korean. At the end of the street
   (corner of Congress and Cedar) there is a coffee shop called Common
   Grounds and a health food cafe called Sobol. 
2. **Cafeterias** within the medical school and hospital are nearby and
   offer a variety of foods. Cafe Med is at Harkness Memorial Hall which
   adjoins the building Cohen is in. The Yale New Haven Hospital has
   a Cafeteria on the first floor. The first floor is very pleasant
   (with fountains and shops) and the cafeteria has a variety of
   stations (you may need to accompany a Yalee to get in). 
3. **Eateries/restaurants** on York include quick places like Subway,
   Family Mediterranean & Pizza, Dunkin Donuts but also sit down places

## Conference Excursion

The excursion on Wednesday will be between 1:00pm-3:30pm. 

Each attendee of SAMPTA 2023 will have the option of one of 3 excursions 
1. Yale Art Gallery guided tour (capped at 30 people), 
2. Yale Tour (Capped at 75 people), 
3. Hike up East Rock (no cap):  From the conference venue, the East Rock
   summit is 3.5 miles of mostly flat walking through the Yale campus
   and then onto paved neighborhood streets. There is a short, strenuous
   climb at the end, ascending 300 vertical feet up a series of giant
   stone steps. The spectacular views from the top look out over New
   Haven and the Long Island Sound. For the return trip, one can either
   retrace the 3.5 miles, or take a convenient Yale shuttle back to the
   venue/hotels to shorten the journey. **Comfortable walking shoes and
   a water bottle are recommended.**
