Note that the schedule contains two different venues (indicated by **P** and **S**, respectively):

- P: Primary Venue: Cohen Auditorium (https://tinyurl.com/samptacohen)
- S: Secondary Venue: Hope 216 Lecture Hall (https://tinyurl.com/samptaHope)

Most of our time, we will be in the **Primary Venue**, but for parallel tracks, we have an additional secondary venue.

## Day 1

On Day 1 we have a reception and POSTER SESSION at the Wu Tsai Institute reception space at 100 College Street from 5-7pm. [More information about WTI is found here](https://wti.yale.edu/).

100 College Street is one of the few higher rise buildings at Yale, [it's on the corner of College and Frontage (map)](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/100-College-St-New-Haven-CT/9650923/). There is security to access this building, but we will be downstairs to escort you up. 

## Day 2

Day 2 will have the same scheduling as Day 1. However, the poster session will be at the lobby of the Hope Building [(on 315 Cedar Street - link to map)](https://www.campus-maps.com/yale-university/hope-memorial-building-315-cedar-st/). There will be poster boards and easels set up for you to hang your poster there. **All poster presenters are welcome to present at BOTH POSTER SESSIONS**. Poster sizes should be 36" x 48". 

## Day 3

On Day 3 we are having our EXCURSIONS and CONFERENCE DINNER. 

The excursion on Wednesday will be between 1:00pm-3:30pm; the dinner from 6-7pm. Details are on the below pages. Note that we need headcounts - so please register for both before Monday, July 10!

## Breaks and Lunch

There will be some coffee and light breakfast items provided in the morning. 

Lunch is 12pm-1:30pm daily. Lunch is on your own and a chance to network. There are several nearby options for lunch. These include: 
1. **Food carts** on Cedar Street. Starting at about 11:30 there is a tradition of food carts parking on Cedar Street between York and Congress. This is the main street for the Yale School of Medicine and Hospital. There are a variety of cuisines represented, including Italian, Middle Eastern, Chinese, and Korean. At the end of the street (corner of Congress and Cedar) there is a coffee shop called Common Grounds and a health food cafe called Sobol. 
2. **Cafeterias** within the medical school and hospital are nearby and offer a variety of foods. Cafe Med is at Harkness Memorial Hall, which adjoins the building that Cohen is in. The Yale New Haven Hospital has a Cafeteria on the first floor. The first floor is very pleasant (with fountains and shops) and the cafeteria has a variety of stations (you may need to accompany a Yalee to get in). 
3. **Eateries/restaurants** on York include quick places like Subway, Family Mediterranean & Pizza, Dunkin Donuts, as well as sit-down places like Zaroka Bar and Grill, York Street Noodle Shop.
4. **Eateries/restaurants** on College and Crown Streets include Bonchon New Haven, T-swirl Crepe, Pacifico, OhK-Dog New Haven, Olives and Oil, Geronimo, Bar, and many more.
